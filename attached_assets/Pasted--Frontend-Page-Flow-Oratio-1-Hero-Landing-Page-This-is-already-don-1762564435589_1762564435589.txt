# 🎯 **Frontend Dev Notes**

* Use **React Router** for page transitions (`/`, `/home`, `/debate/:id`, `/learn`, `/add`, etc.).
* Maintain **role awareness** (host, debater, spectator) in global state/context; same components, different UI visibility.
* Home Dashboard dynamically filters debates based on time.
* WebSocket listeners on `/ws/debate/{room_id}` update transcripts and reactions.
* Use **lazy loading** for Debate Arena and Replay pages (heavy AI data).
* Keep **responsive layout** (works on desktop + tablet).
